# CV
Computer Vision projects

In these four projects I  developed some computer vision applications. A brief description of each one of them follows, but for a more extensive one you can find the report in the corresponding folder. 

Scripts: C++ with OpenCV framework

# Edge detection and Hough transform
In this homework I segment and extract street
lanes and signs using the Hough transform and I color the rightmost lane in red and the sign in green.

# Image Equalization, Histograms, Filters, Morphological Operators
In this homework I first equalize the histogram of
a given image. Then, I generate a denoised
version of the image using different filters and parameters. Lastly, I use different morphological operators in order to remove  electric cables and the handle of the
barbecue in the same image without damaging too much the rest of the picture.

# Licence Plate Recognition
In this homework I first recognize and extract the plates from some given car images. Then I extract the individual characters of the plate and, finally, I classify and read
each character.

# Panoramic Image
In this homework I first project the set of images in a cylinder
surface. Then, I extract the ORB features that are then matched for subsequent images, to identify the right points of connection.
Finally, I crop the images and stitch them one after
the other, to create the final panoramic image.
